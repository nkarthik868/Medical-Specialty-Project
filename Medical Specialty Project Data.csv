I enjoyed my rotation and I felt like this specialty fit well with my skill set and personality. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Surgeon personality, hate long rounding, love being in the OR, loved MSK week and ortho lectures, enjoyed my time when i tried shadowing, played sports in high school, have active lifestyle, like learning about MSK anatomy and pathology, its one of the only fields in medicine where you can fix something instead of managing conditions, want to help others be able to have a better lifestyle",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Please briefly explain how the order of your core clerkships impacted your choice of specialty:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Internal medicine coming after surgery cemented my desire to pursue it. I was also much more comfortable as it was towards the end of my third year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Having my chosen specialty early in my third year allowed me to find mentors early and plan for my fourth year with enough time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Internal medicine was the first clerkship.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was my last rotation so I knew by then that it was obviously better than anything that came before it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I came to really love psychiatry and was very successful in my AI so had i seen it sooner i may have switched away from pathology ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Was able to take an early elective in cardiac surgery since I completed my surgery core first ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Had psychiatry near the end, best opportunity to compare with other specialties as they were all done",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"My chosen specialty was my last clerkship, and delayed my decision significantly (the rotation was also affected by covid).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Exposure to other specialties I hated,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Almost hoped I would not like my last rotation (surgery) so that I would not have to make a difficult decision late in the process.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"more excitement at the beginning, covid-19 shortened later rotations",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I felt less likely to choose specialties related to my core rotations later in the year, because I had to schedule acting internships and electives for 4th year prior to completing many rotations and I did not know if I liked them or not",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Having mine later allowed me to realize that I liked it more than everything I had done previously with no hesitation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Covid,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
having surgery early gave me flexibility,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Could not do away rotations earlier.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Surgery+EM first,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
might have considered psychiatry more strongly had it not been the last rotation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yes I had ob gyn first and didn’t know I’d be interested. Whereas if I had ob gyn last after having to make a decision for aways I might have decided on general surgery as it was my 2nd favorite rotation ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
N/a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"My experience on my core clerkship in my given specialty was relatively negative, partly because it was my first rotation and I was still unsure about what the role of a third year medical student was on the care team. Was not sure how much clinical initiative was appropriate!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was not exposed to clinical practice in my chosen specialty until my last core clerkship.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I made sure to do neurology in the middle so I had IM before neuro,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I didn't have IM first or last, it was squarely in the middle and I felt prepared and also able to tie my IM knowledge into future clerkships",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I had desired specialty last, so I was very comfortable in a hospital setting and with basics of clinical care by the time I got to my specialty ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Probably would have continued with EM or had to take a year off if my surgery rotation hadn’t been prior to December of my third year,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mlml,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had time to explore other specialties and get used to inpatient care during 3rd year so I could compare my internal med rotation to those and not be worrying about learning the EMR for example,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Waited too long in the year to do surgery clerkship and felt burnt out by the time I did Core 4 and didn't perform as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If I had had OBGYN earlier I may have chosen that. There seemed to be a pressure to choose come Jan Of third year and at that point I had only done surgery and Neuro ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
N/a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Made it more difficult to commit earlier to a surgical specialty since my core clerkship in surgery was later,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Early exposure to surgery and medicine allowed me to choose between them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Early enough to know what subspecialties I enjoyed. planning M4 for a competitive survival sub would be impossible with a late surgery rotation ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Psychiatry was one of my last rotations, would have liked earlier to decide earlier",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had ob gym before pediatrics so I could directly compare the two specialities I was interested in. Additionally I had these two in Jan and feb so there was still some time to get AIs in both and plan my elective for the month of March accordingly. Had I had Ob gyn at the end I likely would not have been able to pursue that specialty since all AI spots filled quickly. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"My surgery clerkship, which I was previously interested in, was in the middle, which helped me decide I did not want to pursue it. If I had surgery last I may have stuck with it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I completed surgery before IM, and then did an early AI in IM just after my IM clerkship, which showed me that I really enjoy IM even though I had started to consider surgery",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my very last one was obgyn. think i would have considered it more strongly if i didn't literally have all my AIs, electives, letter writers, plans etc selected. that said I still would have done IM",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I think you need a ""not sure"" option for this question. I think order of rotation will always impact specialty interest, but in ways that you can't plan for. Who knows what I'd be going into if, for example, I'd had an ortho rotation earlier in my M3 year and met a research mentor, or had a less miserable group of Ob/Gyn residents on that rotation. There's a lot of room for serendipity to occur in this process. And just as much room for the negative version of serendipity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Seeing general surgery early enough helped me plan electives in surgical sub specialties to ensure gen surg was right for me ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I had an early clerkship in neurology, which made me strongly consider going into neurology. But then I had my IM clerkship later in the year and then did my AIs in medicine and neurology later in the year to make my final decision",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had surgery at the end which made the decision a little more difficult. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I also enjoyed my psychiatry rotation, but this was my last rotation and occurred after I had already begun preparing to apply in OB/GYN",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I did IM first and that shaped how I thought about patients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I would have been more willing to consider other surgical subspecialties had my general surgery clerkship not been last,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
confirmed that i liked the lifestyle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I felt pressured to decide on a chosen specialty prior to completing my Surgery/EM rotation in Spring of MS3 year. I would have liked to experience EM prior to making this decision.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
having surgery first allowed me to see what the life of surgery was,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had an early rotation in my chosen specialty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Im not sure I would've done neurology if it was last, but I think that is because I would've had to scramble to find appropriate AIs, electives, etc. to satisfy residency applicaiton requirements.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I went into third year expecting to go into a different surgical specialty, ended up getting experience in different surgical fields, liked ortho more.  I had my surgery clerkship last and purposefully did a week of ortho during that clerkship in order to get more exposure to the field.  If I had surgery as my first clerkship before knowing I wanted to seek out that clinical exposure, I may not have had that experience that proved critical in my decision to pursue my chosen specialty.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Allowed me to explore broad options first before narrowing down my choices ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I did emergency medicine last and didnt like anything before,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I thought I wanted to do ENT and if that had been my first rotation I probably would have liked the rotation way more (I was annoyed partially by the lack of autonomy). Also the longitudinal track allowed me to get exposure to everything else before surgery, so I felt confident ruling everything else out without the disadvantage of having it in spring. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Had surgery first - confirmed interest in surgery. Did not consider medical specialties as much ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Having opportunity to do electives early on and doing surgery early. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I believe if I had done surgery before medicine I might have decided to go into a surgical specialty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Late exposure to IM in third year,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I did IM early and gave me more time to think,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
